* Hi! I'm a Northwestern University computer science and statistics junior with interests in artificial intelligence: specifically deep learning, computer vision, and their mathematical foundations and theory. 
* I am particularly interested in foundational research with broad applications not only to computer science and engineering, but with potential to improve society through avenues such as healthcare. I aim to pursue an academic career in research and teaching at the university level. 
* I am grateful to be advised by [Prof. Aggelos Katsaggelos](https://ivpl.northwestern.edu/) in the Image and Video Processing Lab (IVPL), in addition to collaborating with [Prof. Ollie Cossairt](https://compphotolab.northwestern.edu/) and the Computational Photography Lab.
