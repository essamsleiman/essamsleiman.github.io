Hi! 👋 I'm a 1st year Masters in CS student at Harvard University with an interest in deep learning, computer vision & natural language processing.

I am a research assistant focused on self-supervised representation Learning, vision-language learning, and adversarial robustness. Previously I worked in deep learning for healthcare at Stanford and also spent some time at [Twitch/Amazon](https://www.twitch.tv/) as an Applied Scientist where I worked on self-supervised and continual visual representation learning on streaming video data.

# Experience

## [Twitch/Amazon](https://www.twitch.tv/) 3X Internship 📺

- **2022 (Applied Science):** Developed unsupervised, continual learning framework on Twitch Streaming data. Framework allows for ML models developed by Twitch to continuously and intelligently update on new streams such that a model learns new representations without forgetting old ones.

- **2021 Fall (Software Engineer):** Designed & developed an end-to-end, real-time Media-Analysis backend service integrated with both other AWS services and my trained ML model to moderate Twitch’s 9.36M+ streamers’ content. Service is in production!

- **2021 Summer (Applied Science):** Developed a Twitch content representation Image Embedding trained using self-supervised learning. Improved prior method's performance on downstream tasks such as Game Stream Classification by ~10%.

## Undergraduate Research Intern 💻

- **Research @ UC Davis** under [Dr. Hamed Pirsiavash](https://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~hpirsiav/)

  - Project 1: Adversarial robustness for vision Transformers
  - Project 2: Improving compositional reasoning of vision-language models

- **Research @ Stanford University** under [Dr. Dennis Wall](https://profiles.stanford.edu/dennis-wall) and [Dr. Peter Washington](https://peterwashington.github.io/).
  - Project 1 (First Author): Deep Learning-Based Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) Detection Using Emotion Features From Video Recordings.  
    **[Published in JMIR 2022]**.
  - Project 2: Novel Facial Emotion Recognition Dataset: "TikTok for Good: Creating a Diverse Emotion Expression Database".  
    **[Published at CVPRW 2022]**.
  - Project 3: Mitigating Negative Transfer in Multi-Task Learning with Exponential Moving Average Loss Weighting Strategies.  
    **[Published at AAAI Student Abstract 2023]**

<!-- ## [Codelab](https://codelabdavis.com/) (Cofounder/President) 🏫

- UC Davis student organization that builds software for high-growth startups
- Cofounder/President where I grew organization from 7 members to 30+ within a year and which now has grown into 60+ members
- Reached out to hundreds of startups prior to each cohort, negotiated project scope and needs, and finalized agreements with startup clients
- Led weekly meetings with CodeLab leadership to reinforce direction, improve student member experience, and ensure project completion for our clients
- Project Mentor for CodeLab's ReFocus AI, Family Proud, and Ambii client startup teams. Collaborated with company leadership regularly to ensure CodeLab met their needs. Successfully delivered high quality projects that exceeded startup client expectations

## [Komma](https://github.com/essamsleiman/komma-web/) (Cofounder/CTO) 🏢

- A web app which simplifies the way sales representatives schedule meetings
- As Co-Founder/CTO, I led development of full-stack web application using React.js, Node.js, MongoDB, GCP, & AWS
- Communicated with customers regularly for feedback & implemented necessary improvements
- Released application as Beta, but eventually halted the project as we struggled to find product-market fit. Learned a lot along the process -->
