Hi! üëã I'm a 4th year computer science student at UC Davis with a broad interest in computer vision & machine learning and how they can be applied to solve important societal problems.

Ever since I was a kid, I have been extremely excited about technology and how it can be used to solve the problems around me. Motivated by this goal, I co-founded [Komma](https://github.com/essamsleiman/komma-web/) as the CTO with three of my classmates in my freshman year of college with the goal of simplifying the way sales representatives schedule meetings. Energized by the experience of iteratively building features to solve customer problems, I became the Founding President of [Codelab](https://codelabdavis.com/), a UC Davis student-run software and design agency with 60+ members (the largest CS club at UC Davis), where we consult software projects for tech startups.

Most recently I've become passionate about Machine Learning through joining [Twitch/Amazon](https://www.twitch.tv/) for three internships as an ML Engineer where I worked on unsupervised and continual visual representation learning on streaming video data and conducting undergraduate ML research at UC Davis and Stanford University focused on multi-modal representation Learning and applications of ML in healthcare, respectively.

# Experience

## [Twitch/Amazon](https://www.twitch.tv/) 3X Internship üì∫

- **2022 (Applied Science):** Developed unsupervised, continual learning framework on Twitch Streaming data. Framework allows for Machine Learning models developed by Twitch to be continuously and intelligently updated on new streams such that a model always stays up to date, learning new representations without forgetting old ones.

- **2021 Fall (Software Engineer):** Designed & developed an end-to-end, real-time Media-Analysis backend service integrated with both other AWS services and my trained Image Embedding to moderate Twitch‚Äôs 9.36M+ streamers‚Äô content. Service is in production!

- **2021 Summer (Applied Science):** Developed a Twitch content representation Image Embedding trained using self-supervised learning. Improved prior method's performance on downstream tasks such as Game Stream Classification by ~10%.

## Undergraduate Research Intern üíª

- **Research @ UC Davis** under [Dr. Hamed Pirsiavash](https://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~hpirsiav/)

  - Topic: Self-Supervised Learning, Multi-Modal Representation Learning, & Action Recognition

- **Research @ Stanford University** under [Dr. Dennis Wall](https://profiles.stanford.edu/dennis-wall) and [Dr. Peter Washington](https://peterwashington.github.io/).
  - Project 1 (First Author): Deep Learning-Based Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) Detection Using Emotion Features From Video Recordings.  
    **[Published in JMIR 2022]**.
  - Project 2: Novel Facial Emotion Recognition Dataset: "TikTok for Good: Creating a Diverse Emotion Expression Database".  
    **[Published at CVPR 2022]**.
  - Project 3: Mitigating Negative Transfer in Multi-Task Learning with Exponential Moving Average Loss Weighting Strategies.  
    **[Published at AAAI Student Abstract 2023]**

## [Codelab](https://codelabdavis.com/) (Cofounder/President) üè´

- UC Davis student organization that builds software for high-growth startups
- Cofounder/President where I grew organization from 7 members to 30+ within a year and which now has grown into 60+ members
- Reached out to hundreds of startups prior to each cohort, negotiated project scope and needs, and finalized agreements with startup clients
- Led weekly meetings with CodeLab leadership to reinforce direction, improve student member experience, and ensure project completion for our clients
- Project Mentor for CodeLab's ReFocus AI, Family Proud, and Ambii client startup teams. Collaborated with company leadership regularly to ensure CodeLab met their needs. Successfully delivered high quality projects that exceeded startup client expectations

## [Komma](https://github.com/essamsleiman/komma-web/) (Cofounder/CTO) üè¢

- A web app which simplifies the way sales representatives schedule meetings
- As Co-Founder/CTO, I led development of full-stack web application using React.js, Node.js, MongoDB, GCP, & AWS
- Communicated with customers regularly for feedback & implemented necessary improvements
- Released application as Beta, but eventually halted the project as we struggled to find product-market fit. Learned a lot along the process
