Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm essam, currently a masters student at harvard studying cs. I'm interested in machine learning, natural language processing, and multi-modal learning.

I do ml research working with llms and large vision-language models. I previously spent some time at [twitch/amazon](https://www.twitch.tv/) as an applied scientist intern where I worked on their ml team and built their first ml-based video understanding platform, worked on a [startup](https://github.com/essamsleiman/komma-web) to automate meeting scheduling, and ran a [student org](https://www.codelabdavis.com/) doing software consulting for tech companies.

# Industry/Research Experience

- **Research intern at [harvard](https://www.harvard.edu/) & [mit](https://www.mit.edu)** working on nlp and vision-language learning.
- **2x applied sci intern at [twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/)** where I trained their first twitch-wide backbone vision model. Developed a continual learning framework for online model training. Improved downstream task accuracy by 10%. Only undergrad on the ml sci team.
- **software dev eng intern at [amazon/aws](https://aws.amazon.com/ivs/)** where I built first ml-based video understanding platform for IVS. Service in production.
- **Research intern at [uc davis](https://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~hpirsiav/)** working in multimodel representation learning and adversarial robustness.
- **Research intern at [stanford](https://ai.stanford.edu/)** where I worked on ai for healthcare.
- **Co-Founder/CTO at [komma](https://github.com/essamsleiman/komma-web)** where I led full-stack development.
- **Co-Founder/President at [codelab](https://www.codelabdavis.com/)** the largest cs student org with 100+ members where we build software for tech companies.
