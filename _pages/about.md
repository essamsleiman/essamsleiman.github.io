Hi! üëã I'm an incoming 4th year computer science student at UC Davis with a broad interest in machine learning + computer vision and how it can be applied to solve problems with a positive societal impact.

Ever since I was a kid, I have been extremely passionate about technology and how it could be used to solve the problems around me. Motivated by this goal, I co-founded [Komma](https://github.com/essamsleiman/komma-web/) as the CTO with three of my classmates in my freshman year of college with the goal of simplifying the way sales representatives schedule meetings. Energized by the experience of iteratively building features to solve customer problems, I became the Founding President of [Codelab](https://codelabdavis.com/), a UC Davis student-run software and design agency with 60+ members, where we consult software projects for tech startups.

After joining [Twitch/Amazon](https://www.twitch.tv/) for three internships as a Machine Learning Engineer and conducting undergraduate Machine Learning research at both UC Davis and Stanford University, I became passionate and excited about a new tool: Machine Learning. I am particularly interested in researching and applying cutting-edge deep learning and computer vision techniques to solve important problems.

# Experience

## [Twitch/Amazon](https://www.twitch.tv/) 3X Internship üì∫

- **2022 (Applied Science):** Developed novel unsupervised continual learning framework on streaming data.

- **2021 Fall (Software Engineer):** Designed & developed an end-to-end, real-time Media Analysis Service utilizing both Machine-Learning based services, and my trained Image Embedding to moderate Twitch‚Äôs 9.36M+ streamers‚Äô content.

- **2021 Summer (Applied Science):** Developed a Twitch content representation Image Embedding trained using self-supervised learning

## Undergraduate Research Intern üíª

- **Research @ UC Davis** under [Dr. Hamed Pirsiavash](https://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~hpirsiav/)

  - Topic: Self-Supervised Learning, Multi-Modal Representation Learning, & Action Recognition

- **Research @ Stanford University** under [Dr. Dennis Wall](https://profiles.stanford.edu/dennis-wall) and [Dr. Peter Washington](https://peterwashington.github.io/).
  - Project 1 (First Author): Deep Learning-Based Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) Detection Using Emotion Features From Video Recordings.  
    **[Published in JMIR 2022]**.
  - Project 2: Novel Facial Emotion Recognition Dataset, "TikTok for Good: Creating a Diverse Emotion Expression Database".  
    **[Published at CVPR 2022]**.

## [Codelab](https://codelabdavis.com/) (Cofounder/President) üè´

- UC Davis student organization that builds software for high-growth startups
- Cofounder/President where I grew organization from 7 members to 30+ within a year and which now has grown into 60+ members
- Reached out to hundreds of startups prior to each cohort, negotiated project scope and needs, and finalized agreements with startup clients
- Led weekly meetings with CodeLab leadership to reinforce direction, improve student member experience, and ensure project completion for our clients
- Project Mentor for CodeLab's ReFocus AI, Family Proud, and Ambii client startup teams. Collaborated with company leadership regularly to ensure CodeLab met their needs. Successfully delivered high quality projects that exceeded startup client expectations

## [Komma](https://github.com/essamsleiman/komma-web/) (Cofounder/CTO) üè¢

- A web app which simplifies the way sales representatives schedule meetings
- As Co-Founder/CTO, I led development of full-stack web application using React.js, Node.js, MongoDB, GCP, & AWS
- Communicated with customers regularly for feedback & implemented necessary improvements
- Released application as Beta, but eventually halted the project as we struggled to find product-market fit. Learned a lot along the process
